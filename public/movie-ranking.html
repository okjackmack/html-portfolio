<h1>Jack's Top Flicks</h1>
    <h2>Some of my favourite movies to date, in some particular order</h2>

<hr />

    <h3>In The Mood For Love</h3>
        Beautiful and haunting. A kind of rainy, Hong Kongy type film.
    
    <h3>The Big Lebowski</h3>
        The Dude abides.

    <h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
        The first anime I ever watched. It holds a special place in my heart.
